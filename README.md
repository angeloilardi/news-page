## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [TailwindCSS](https://https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I had to use nested grids to arrage the sections in the desktop view. Unlike flexbox, it requires way more set up and a more methodical approach.

Another interesting thing was creating the mobile menu as a sidebar and use state to toggle the menu.


### Continued development

In my next projects, I want to gain some experience with more advanced grid layouts as they can make some very attractive designs

### Useful resources
